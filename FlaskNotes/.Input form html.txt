Give your two buttons the same name and different values:
<form method='POST'>
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Do Something">
    <input type="submit" name="submit" value="Do Something Else">
</form>

Then in your Flask view function you can tell which button was used to submit the form:

def contact():
    if request.method == 'POST':
        if request.form['submit'] == 'Do Something':
            pass # do something
        elif request.form['submit'] == 'Do Something Else':
            pass # do something else
        else:
            pass # unknown
    elif request.method == 'GET':
        return render_template('contact.html', form=form)
